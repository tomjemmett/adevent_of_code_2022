# Advent of Code 2022

This is my attempt at solving this year's Advent of Code, in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Previous year's solutions:

- [2019](https://github.com/tomjemmett/advent_of_code_2019) (R)
- [2020](https://aoc.tjmt.uk/) (R)
- [2021](https://github.com/tomjemmett/advent_of_code_2021) (Haskell)

## How to run

- `cabal run aoc2022` will run all of the days, giving you all of the solutions.
- `cabal test` will run the test suite, ensuring that the results are correct (first against the provided sample, then against the actual result).
